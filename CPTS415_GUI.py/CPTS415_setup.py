# *_setup.py

# *_setup.py contains one class - Setup. This is initialized before the GUI initializes, and is where all
# initial database setup or connection operations should be placed (for instance, logging into the db
# or initializing tables). Should also serve as a container for querying setup states and information (such as)
# if our database is running or not...
class Setup:
	def __init__(self):
